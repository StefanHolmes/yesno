An Elm project to create a simple yes / no interactive website
--------------------------------------------------------------

This is a first 'proper' project in Elm. I have no idea what I'm doing. Functional programming is hard.

I have this project set up so that the 'production' branch is auto-deployed to https://shouldigotothebeach.com using Netlify.
